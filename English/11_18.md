## B.

What is an Operating System? Goals & Functions of OS

OS is a software that acts as an interface for easy and efficient interaction between computer hardware and user. 

## C.

How many of your suppositions were mentioned in the video? Have you got to know any new information from the video?

An example of a fan is mentioned in the video to explain the role of the operating system. A fan can be likened to an operating system, which helps manage and regulate the resources in the system to ensure that the system runs smoothly. Just as a fan can adjust its speed as needed to keep the temperature right, the operating system can manage and allocate computer resources as needed to increase efficiency and ensure stable system operation.
