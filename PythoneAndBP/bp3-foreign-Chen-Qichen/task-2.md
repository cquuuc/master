# Additional questions

- What metrics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the described process?

  > 1. Financial management process:
  >    - Budget implementation rate: the comparison of actual expenditures with the budget, which measures the implementation of the budget.
  >    - Efficiency of capital use: the ratio of capital input to output, reflecting the efficiency of capital utilization.
  >    - Cost Control Indicators: such as the cost per unit of product, the percentage of decrease in operating costs.
  >    - Accuracy of financial reports: the error rate of data in financial statements.
  >      Cash flow health: current ratio, quick ratio, etc., measuring the financial health of the company.
  > 2. R&D process:
  >    1. R&D cycle time: total time from requirements definition to product delivery.
  >    2. R&D Cost Control: actual R&D cost vs. budget.
  >    3. Project completion rate: the percentage of projects completed on time.
  >    4. Product quality indicators: such as test defect rate, user feedback score, etc.
  >    5. Technology innovation rate: the number of new technologies, new patents, and new products developed.

- What risks are associated with the implementation of the process and how can they be minimized?

  > 1. Financial management process risk:
  >
  >    - Budget overrun: may lead to underfunding.
  >    - Minimization methods: real-time monitoring of budget execution, using budget early warning system.
  >    - Financial data error: affects decision-making accuracy.
  >    - Minimization methods: introduce automated financial tools and audit financial data regularly.
  >    - Liquidity risk: Insufficient funds to support operations.
  >      Minimization method: Regularly assess cash flow and establish contingency fund reserve.
  >
  >    
  >
  > 2. R&D process risk:
  >
  >    - Changes in requirements: frequent changes in requirements lead to longer development time.
  >    - Minimization method: Adopt agile development method and communicate with the demand side regularly.
  >    - Technical risk: the difficulty of technical realization exceeds the expectation.
  >    - Minimization method: Conduct technical feasibility analysis in the planning stage and implement in phases.
  >    - Resource shortage: Insufficient R&D staff or budget.
  >    - Minimization method: Optimize resource allocation, use outsourcing or third-party technology.
  >
  >
